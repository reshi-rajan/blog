###### Research Interests

My research interests are currently focused on comparative political behavior & institutions, quantitative methods, and formal theory. My research specifically looks at ways in which institutional arrangements (e.g. voting systems, system of government, etc.) influence voters in democracies.

###### MA Thesis

My MA thesis studied which voters follow How To Vote Cards in Australia. My thesis committee included Shane P. Singh, Mollie J. Cohen, and Joseph T. Ornstein.
