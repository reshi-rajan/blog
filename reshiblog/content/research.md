###### Research Interests

My research interests are currently focused on comparative political behavior & institutions, quantitative methods, and formal theory. My research specifically looks at ways in which institutional arrangements (e.g. voting systems, government type, etc.) influence voters in democracies.

###### Works in Progress

1. The Effects of Compulsory Voting: A Case Study in Karnataka, India _with Shane P. Singh_

2. Modeling Ideological Polarization: Spatial Modeling of Ideological Shifts

3. Predicting Coalition Formation Using Notions of p-adic distance
