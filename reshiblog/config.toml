  About = "Howdy! I am Reshi Rajan, a first year PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Texas A&M University's Bush School of Government in College Station, Texas. My research interests are primarily in comparative political behavior and institutions as well as quantitative methodology (particularly maximum likelihood estimation) and formal political theory (spatial voting models). I earned my B.A. in International Affairs with a minor in Mathematics from the University of Georgia in 2023 as well as my M.A. in Political Science. In addition to my research interests in Political Science, my interests in pure mathematics focus on Number Theory, specifically arithmetic in the Quaternions."
