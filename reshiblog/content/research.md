###### Research Interests

My research interests are currently focused on comparative political behavior & institutions, quantitative methods, and formal theory. My research specifically looks at ways in which institutional arrangements (e.g. voting systems, system of government, etc.) influence voters in democracies.

###### MA Thesis

My MA thesis looks at which voters follow HTV cards in Australia; it can be found at this [link](https://outlookuga-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/rr09094_uga_edu/EbzzR8jrNJNPmnd7rgrYiRwBrre4t6K7_sQ3tbIDP3tj4A?e=RsyyaZ).
